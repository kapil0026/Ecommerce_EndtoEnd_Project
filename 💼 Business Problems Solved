💼 Business Problems Solved
This project helps solve real-world business challenges faced by eCommerce companies using data-driven insights:

1. 📉 Monthly Sales Performance Fluctuations
Problem: Sales vary greatly across months without clear patterns.

Solution: The notebook’s month-wise sales trend analysis reveals seasonal peaks and dips to guide promotional planning.

2. 🧾 Top-Grossing Product Categories
Problem: Uncertainty about which product categories drive most revenue.

Solution: Category-wise and sub-category-wise sales breakdown helps prioritize high-performing product lines.

3. 💰 Profitability Misalignment
Problem: High sales do not always mean high profits.

Solution: Sales and profit visualizations by month and category identify profit leakages despite strong revenue.

4. 🧍‍♂️ Customer Segment Targeting
Problem: Lack of clarity on which customer groups are most valuable.

Solution: Segment-wise analysis of sales and profit guides targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.

5. 📦 Sub-Category Optimization
Problem: Inefficient stock and inventory decisions due to unclear sub-category performance.

Solution: Detailed sub-category bar charts help decide which product lines to expand or phase out.

6. ⚖️ Sales-to-Profit Ratio Monitoring
Problem: Business lacks visibility into profitability efficiency.

Solution: Comparing sales vs. profit by segment/category helps optimize pricing, discount strategies, and cost control.
